## Description

With RHarbor, you can manage your multiple connection informations for Remote Desktop and SSH.

You need not to feel the change of usability since RHarbor uses Windows-standard remote desktop application (`mstsc.exe`).

RHarbor is recommended for the following people.

- You need to connect to many remote servers
- You need to connect to a remote server via SSH servers (so-called "bastion")
- You need to forward a port of a remote server easily
- You need to manage connection informations in one place.

Especially it comes in handy when you have to go through the multiple SSH server to connect the destination Windows machine.

RHarbor is not able to use as a SSH client/terminal but can call your favorite SSH clients with the stored SSH connection informations.

## About connection settings

### Where to store

`RHarbor.db` exists in the same folder as `RHarbor.exe`. This file contains RHarbor's settings you were set.

### Clear all settings

To initialize the setting please shutdown RHarbor and then delete `RHarbor.db`. New `RHarbor.db` will be generated when you start RHarbor again.

### Back up

To back up your connection settings, just copy `RHarbor.db` to your backup location.

RHarbor automatically backs it up to your profile folder (typically `C:\Users\<Username>\AppData\Roaming\RHarbor`).

## Notice

### SSH private key file

OpenSSH-format private key files (e.g. generated by `ssh-keygen`) are allowed.

PuTTy format private key files should be converted to OpenSSH format using [puttygen.exe](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html).

RHarbor doesn't care the key file extension.

### Password security

The passwords stored in RHarbor are encrypted but still remains some security risks.

Do not install in a shared computer.

Malicious programs or bad people may read passwords in the database file or in memory.

Please make sure that an appropriate antivirus software is installed on your computer and use on your own risk.
